	<h2 class = "intro"> Hello. My name is Luisa Hernandez and this is my last semester at NYU. I am double majoring in computer science and linguistics/Spanish. I am excited for this course because it will be a fun application of linear algebra. This class will allow me to intuitively see how a matrix can translate, rotate, or shear an object. I hope that we get to cover topics and examples of animations and 2D games.
