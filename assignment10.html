	<h2 class = "intro"> My exposure to virtual reality is minimal. However, I was highly interested in this week's presentations because they demonstrate the applications of virtual reality and how they can affect animations and the real world. In my opinion, computer graphics will always be a highly innovative field, as people are interested and determined to more accurately depict a fictional world.

	The presentation of Luis Velho addresses the question of realism in virtual reality. His project is particularly interesting because it is the first time that actors in a scene are fully immersed in a virtual set and their live performance is shown to the public on a screen as a real-time computer graphics. However, there are limitations in the abilities of virtual reality. This would be why his characters are only able to move in a small portion of a room.

	Quite differently, the CAVE project of Sebastian Herscher is more about capturing the environment and atmosphere of the theater. This can be done by creating a virtual character that guides you through a new world, being able to create your own surroundings, and interacting with other animated characters. He focuses on addressing problems regarding interactions between the audiences' avatars.

	I am surprised and excited about how natural and immersive these experiences are. There is a bright future ahead for virtual reality. As it becomes more accessible in our society, these types of expereinces will no longer be considered unattainable. Virtual reality is not a part of our day-to-day life the way that other technologies are. I think that very soon it will be incorporated into the many ordinary things that we do, but we are simply not there yet.
